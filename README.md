## Installation
Will write an install script at some point...

### Network Share Mounting
Network share is through sshfs.
1. Make sure to manually mount the sshfs as root at least once, using user ssh keys, to ensure host's public key is in root's known_hosts file.
2. Edit fstab [accordingly](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSHFS#Secure_user_access).
